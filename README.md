## User Story
```
As a user, 
I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once 
SO THAT I have quick access to their non-sensitive information.
```

## Functionality

When the user loads the page, a table of employees should render with: 
* name
* email
* location

The user should be able to:
* Sort the table by name, email, location
* Filter the employees by name and location
